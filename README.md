Coding language I built somewhat from scratch. Please let me know of any errors or any suggestions!


##Syntax:

(Similar to java)

For Loops:
```
for (i < 3; +1) {
  
}
```
'i', '3', and '1' can be replaced with an already declared variable. If not using an undeclared variable, i will default to having a value of 0. The '<' can be replaced with the comparators: ==, !=, <=, >=, >, and <.
