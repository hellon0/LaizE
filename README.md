# LaizE
Coding language I built somewhat from scratch. Please let me know of any errors or any suggestions! You'll notice it's very similar to java, as I'm too lazy to come up with my own token names and formats.


##Syntax:


### Variables:
```
var value = 0;
value = value + 1;
```
When assigning a value to a variable, a variable type will be auto assigned, making you unable to (for example) change an integer to a string. A variable will be assigned to a boolean if it has a true or false value, or if it contains a comparator. 'And' and 'or' statements work the same as they do in java (ex. condition1 == condition2 || condition3 == condition4). Variable types include string, int, dec (decimal), and boolean. To reassign a variable value, enter the same statement not including 'var'. There's currently no shortcut to add, subtract, divide, or multiply numbers.

### Print:
`prt("Hello World"); `
Use '+' to insert a variable into the statement

### For Loops:
```
for (i < 3; +1) {
  
}
```
'i', '3', and '1' can be replaced with an already declared variable. If not using an undeclared variable, i will default to having a value of 0. The '<' can be replaced with the comparators: ==, !=, <=, >=, >, and <.

### If/Elsif/Else statements:
```
if (value == 1) {
  prt("value = 1");
} elsif (value == 2) {
  prt("value = 2");
} else {
  prt("value doesn't equal 1 or 2");
}
```
The only difference between these and the ones in Java are 'else if' being changed to 'elsif'. I'm very creative as you can see.

### While loops:
```
while (value != 2) {
 value = value + 1;
}
```
There's no difference between these and while loops in Java.

### Math:
```
var value = 2*(3+5)/2-4;
```
Math isn't any different to Java, other than lacking features like Modulus and Exponents. Math methods are also not included yet.


### Unincluded Features
Features I've yet to include are `break`, math shortcuts (`value++;`), variable methods.

Let me know if I forgot anything!
